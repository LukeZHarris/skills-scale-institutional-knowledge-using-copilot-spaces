# OctoAcme Project Management Process — Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This overview synthesizes our established project lifecycle and key workflows to help new team members quickly understand how we deliver value from idea to production. OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible approach grounded in five core principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our process is designed to reduce friction, maintain transparency, and enable teams to ship reliably while continuously improving.

Our project lifecycle consists of five interconnected phases: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution & Tracking**, **Release & Deployment**, and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**. During **Initiation**, we validate business needs through a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline (see octoacme-project-initiation.md for the template). The **Planning** phase translates approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with acceptance criteria, estimates, and a Definition of Done, while identifying dependencies and risks through kickoff meetings and sprint planning activities (detailed in octoacme-project-planning.md). **Execution & Tracking** is where daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and our project board workflow—moving items through Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done—keep work visible and blockers escalated promptly. Our PR conventions emphasize small, reviewable changes (<= 400 lines when possible), explicit issue links, and passing CI checks including unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, and manual QA validation as appropriate (see octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md). The **Release & Deployment** phase ensures that only fully validated features reach production, with pre-release checklists covering acceptance criteria completion, smoke tests, rollback plans, and post-deploy verification steps (octoacme-release-and-deployment.md). Finally, the **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** phase closes the loop by capturing "what went well" and "what could be improved," prioritizing 2-3 action items per retrospective, and tracking them through to completion in subsequent cycles (octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md).

Each phase involves clearly defined roles and responsibilities. **Project Managers** coordinate delivery schedules, manage risks and dependencies, facilitate meetings (kickoffs, planning, retrospectives), and maintain consistent status reporting. **Product Managers** define outcomes, prioritize the roadmap and backlog, set acceptance criteria, and measure success against defined metrics. **Developers** implement features to meet acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, participate in code reviews, and help identify technical risks. **QA/Testing** validates quality standards, verifies acceptance criteria, and ensures features meet the Definition of Done before release. **Stakeholders** provide inputs, approvals, and feedback throughout the lifecycle. These roles work in concert through a regular communication cadence: daily standups for the delivery team, weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager, weekly delivery syncs to review progress and risks, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks are tracked in a Risk Register with clear owners, impact and likelihood assessments, mitigation plans, and status updates reviewed weekly. When blockers arise, escalation follows a defined path from team-level triage to PM, then to Product Lead, and ultimately to sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues (see octoacme-roles-and-personas.md and octoacme-risks-and-communication.md for comprehensive role definitions and communication templates).

Quality assurance is embedded throughout our process. Every backlog item includes explicit acceptance criteria established during planning, and the team's Definition of Done ensures consistency in what "complete" means. Before code reaches production, it passes through unit tests, integration tests where applicable, smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI. Manual QA validates feature acceptance when automated testing isn't sufficient. Risk and dependency management is proactive: we identify risks during planning and monitor them weekly, capturing cross-team dependencies on the project board and escalating during syncs. Post-deployment, we verify success metrics, run smoke tests, and monitor dashboards for errors, latency, and usage signals. The continuous improvement loop ensures that action items from retrospectives are added to the backlog with clear owners and due dates, reviewed in weekly PM syncs, and measured for impact. For more detailed workflows, see octoacme-project-management-overview.md for high-level context on principles and key artifacts.

## Why This Matters

Centralizing and documenting our project management processes creates shared knowledge that benefits everyone. New team members reduce onboarding time by accessing clear, consistent guidance without relying solely on tribal knowledge or ad-hoc explanations. Teams execute more consistently, reducing confusion about workflows, roles, and expectations. When processes are explicit and cross-referenced, contributors can find the right template or checklist quickly, leading to fewer mistakes and faster decisions. This documentation also serves as a living reference that evolves with our practices—by codifying what works and continuously improving through retrospectives, we build institutional knowledge that scales beyond individual teams and tenures.

## Next Steps

These process documents are living artifacts that improve through team feedback and contributions. If you identify gaps, outdated guidance, or opportunities to clarify workflows, please use the issue template at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml` to suggest improvements. Your input helps ensure our documentation stays accurate, actionable, and valuable for current and future team members.
